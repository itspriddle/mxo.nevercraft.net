1125167558|Musou|Development on Hold|Yeah, dev is on hold.  I'm busy with two other paying jobs so the free stuff gets put on hold...<br /><br />My poor MXO account hasn't been transferred yet either.  So sad...<br /><br />I really do miss it.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|3||
1124827237|Musou|Image Galleries Complete|I've completed the image galleries (2 days ago actually).  <br /><br />Some important notes:<br /> - You can only use JPEGs!<br /> - Images must be smaller than 300kb<br /> - You have 5 mb to work with<br /><br />If you find you're running out of space try resizing or resampling your screens to see if you can get them to a smaller file size.<br /><br />The GD Lib (the thing that makes the thumbnails) only supports JPEG because the compression algorithm for GIF is copyrighted.  Apparantly this just happened...<br /><br />If after a while its obvious that 5mb isnt enough space (and what people are using isnt being abused (and my host doesnt get upset)) I might up the limit.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|5||
1124440267|Musou|Image Galleries Up|Image galleries are semi-functional.  Each user is allowed 5 mb worth of images.  You can currently upload and view galleries.  Delete comes tomorrow or Sat.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|5||
1124429544|Musou|Slowly but Surely|I'm slowly adding components to the site.  Currently, users can update their biographies and upload an avatar image.  I should have the script finished soon for uploading for image galleries.  Might take a little longer to actually make the script to VIEW those images, but Iver and I are the only members right now anyway...||/images/avatars/musou.gif|5||
1124268065|Musou|Fixed|Fixed some major code bugs.  And I joined Spread Firefox because Firefox rocks and EVERYONE should use it.

If you're not using it go to the bottom of this page and click the cool little button.<br /><br />"Firefox doesn't load this page right."<br /><br />That is because the developers are lazy and used poor code that only renders on IE.  IE has many (many, many) bugs that will let CSS or other code render properly.  Look at it in any other browser and its hell.<br /><br />Its fun to design for crossbrowser goodness.<br /><br />Yeah I'm going to go to sleep now....|/images/avatars/musou.gif|3||
1124062942|Musou|Bugs|I'm in the middle of a code rehaul so don't be suprised if something doesn't work or works improperly.<br /><br />Once I'm done, I promise it'll work in IE and Firefox.<br /><br />If you find any errors please email me.<br /><br />And on that note... I'm taking a break.  I can't stare at CSS declarations any longer.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|3||

I think you guys will be happy with it when I'm finished.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in beta testing this, send me an email with your desired username/password.  It might take me a while to get this all going and debugged so I could use any help.|/images/avatars/musou.gif|3||
1123899241|Musou|Member Pages|When the site is finished, all registered users will have thier own profile pages.  Maybe I'm just a loser, but I'm genuinely very happy to have been able to code this.  Anyhow, once its finished everyone will have http://users.mxo.nevercraft.net/~username active.  You'll be able to upload screenshots, add a bio, keep a Mega City journal...  I guess I'm just a geek, but the fact that I was able to generate this code amazes me.  Anyone with ideas for this section please email me.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|1||
1123838385|Musou|Members Section|I'm working now on the members section, so if anyone reads this send me the following: MXO Character Name, desired password, e-mail address, captain.  I'll add your info and e-mail you back.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|1||
1123821441|Iver|My solo missioning experience.|So yesterday was the first time I truly missioned as a martial artist and I've found that its the best all-around discipline to solo as.  The boost in combat tactics and melee damage as well as hp makes it especially easy to flow through missions without dieing.  So tonight, I end on a 14 million exp day.||http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/4456/avatoar1ib.jpg|4||
1123818167|Musou|Site Finished (More or Less)|Our site is more or less finished.  Just need to create a members section (gotta have something to offer people right?) and fill it with content.<br /><br />If you have anything usefull you'd like to share please email me.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|3||

1123747780|Musou|More CSS|I don't know if you've noticed yet, but I like to fill this section with uselessness about my progress with a cross-browser CSS driven layout.  I'm doing well if you care to know...||/images/avatars/musou.gif|1||
1123662362|Musou|Grrr!|I'm having the worst time with this CSS.  It's been pissing me off for hours and its likely to continue...|I'm having the worst time with this CSS.  It's been pissing me off for hours and its likely to continue...<br /><br />So in css theres a property called border.  Excellent, great.  Anyone who knows anything about CSS knows about border: 1px solid black; So you make a class, give it a width (400px), give it a height (200px), give it a border(1px).  Cool, I'm going to have a 400 x 200 box with a border 1px wide.<br /><br />Yeah, you'll get that alright, but the difference lays in the browser you use.  Internet Explorer sees that, gives you a nice box with a border.  If you measure from edge to edge including the border, you'll have 400 x 200.  <br /><br />Try it in Firefox.  It looks pretty much the same.  Measure it.  You'll see that from edge to edge including the border its 402 x 202.  They see the border and add its size into the width and height.<br /><br />Pisses you off if those 2 pixels make a difference, and they do.  Who to blame?  <ul><br /><li> Microsoft for their engine that technically cheats the CSS box model?</li><br /><li>Mozilla for adding those two pixels?</li><br /><li>W3C for being assholes with CSS 1.0 and the box model/border property?</li><br /></ul>|/images/avatars/musou.gif|1||
1123570024|Musou|More Changes|I've reformatted the newsfeed with some CSS.  Nothing too fancy, but it works and its all in CSS (with an avatar image).<br /><br />Am I the only one who thinks its hilarious how quickly you can die in Center Park?  Got interlocked and destroyed in 1 hit.  I'm only lvl 19, but I thought it was freaking hilarious.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|1|||
1123520776|Musou|Layout|The layout is probably pretty messed up right now...  Don't freak out, man!  I'm probably im the middle of fixing something....<br /><br />I am actually, but I get to go to work first. <br /><br />More updates when I return.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|1|||
1123486526|Musou|About the board...|I'm pretty sure there were only 3 people who had registered on the board.  Anyway, somehow it got deleted, so I had to reinstall it.  It wouldn't let me install and keep the sql tables that I'd already made so I had to delete them.  Anyone who had registered needs to do so again.||/images/avatars/musou.gif|1|||
